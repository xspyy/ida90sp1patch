# ida 9.0 SP1 patching
steps:
1. Move the ida.dll file from the repository
2. Copy the ida.dll file from the repository to the folder where IDA is installed (e.g., C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.0).
3. compile & run main.cpp
4. change main.cpp where it says "Change this"
5. Move the license file THEN save the generated file and place it in the root folder of IDA (where ida64.exe is)
**AND FINALLY, RUN IDA PRO!**
Now you can use IDA Pro 9.0 sp1 **with a license**!
